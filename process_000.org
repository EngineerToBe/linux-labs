#+TITLE: What is Process?

The definition of Process is very simple its the *running* *a* *program* . Program is nothing but a set of instruction to be excuted.
To understand what constitutes a process, we thus have to understand its machine state: what a program can read or update when it is running.
At any given time, what parts of the machine are important to the execu-
tion of this program?
One obvious component of machine state that comprises a process is its memory. Instructions lie in memory; the data that the running pro-gram reads and writes sits in memory as well. Thus the memory that the
process can address (called its address space) is part of the process.
Also part of the processâ€™s machine state are registers; many instructions explicitly read or update registers and thus clearly they are important to
the execution of the process.


* Process Creation

  Operating System loads the program into memory and the address space to execute the program and create a process. Intially a program can resides in the Hard Disk or
  some flash disk. Operating System reads those bytes and lods into memory somewhere. Once the program loaded into the memore Operating System allocate some meory to the
  program and is is known as Stack. Once it is done the OS now executes the program.

* Process States

  There are 3 states a *Process* can be in

  - running
    Process is running and executing the instructions.
  - ready
    Process is ready to run, but for some reason OS not to run at a given moment.
  - block
    Porcess is blocked for some other reason.

* System Calls

  - fork()
    When a Program runs its gets its PID (Process Identifier), the process calls the fork() with which a new process is created. This porcess is the exact copy of the original
    process, the new process is child process and its exists as the older process calls the System Call fork().

  - wait()
    This is useful when the child process is still running, the parent process calls the wait() system call until the child process dont finish.

  - exec()
    This syetem call is use when some other process needs to be executed in the parent process.
